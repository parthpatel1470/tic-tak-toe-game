# Tic-tac-toe Game
```
This is a simple Tic-tac-toe game implemented in React Native using TypeScript. It allows two players to play the game on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns marking cells with their respective symbols ('X' and 'O'), and the first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all cells are filled and no player wins, the game ends in a draw.
